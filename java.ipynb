    "When it comes to storing information in computers all boil down at the end of the day to two places:\n",
    "\n",
    "- memory modules,\n",
    "- hard disks (either SSD or HDD).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now when we are talking about storing data within a program/application, the only place possible is the memory module. This is the **only** location where **all** variables content is stored. If you have a variable that holds some value (such as a number, a string, or a dictionary), that value will live and exists only inside the memory module. \n",
    "\n",
    "Memory modules (and hard disks too) are nothing more than a long sequence of bytes (1 byte = 8 bit - a bit can be either 1 or 0). Think of it as a long array, where every position is a single byte. \n",
    "\n",
    "Or in a more real-world analogy, it's a book library with a single very-very long shelf used for storage. Now the shelf has markers alongside it, starting from position zero, and increasing one by one up to the size of the memory of your computer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 gigabyte = 1024 MegaBytes, \n",
    "- 1 Megabyte = 1024 KiloBytes,\n",
    "- 1 Kilo Bytes = 1024 Bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if your computer has 1GB it has available ``1024 * 1024 * 1024 = 1 073 741 824`` cells. So this long memory shelf will contain roughly a bit over one billion markers for every gigabyte on your computer. These markers allow our librarian to retrieve books from a shelf quickly; e.g., if someone comes that hey give me a book from position 1233, they can just go immediately to that marker and return the value (book) stored there. \n",
    "\n",
    "Any data (variable) you use in a program will need to exists somewhere here on this shelf. The application itself does not holds/contain the data, it's the memory module that holds it. Now the memory module has a very strict librarian; the librarian does not allow anyone to go into the library themselves. All information/book must be retrieved by going to the librarian and asking for it. Similarly anything that goes into the library (new book/information) must go through the librarian. You show up with the book, he'll look at the library and put it somewhere; and then give you back the marker position where it was left.\n",

    "4. The librarian only gets the outcome of the right hand side, the number 4. Looks at it, sees also that it has a size of integer, looks at its shelf, sees there's a free position at marker 2.1 million with length 4 (needed for an int, so he puts it there).\n",
    "5. In the next line we say we want to print result, what we really are saying is that we want to print the value storred at marker 2.1 million. So the System.out.println, actually goes to the librarian, says look I've been asked to print out what's at result, that is at marker 2.1 million, give the the value of that, I'll send it to the processor that then sends it to the graphic processing unit, showing the value 4 on the screen.\n",

When you have some data that you want to store, they don't return you the position on the shelf but instead they give you a human readable name. In the above case we've used:\n",
